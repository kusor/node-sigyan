# Sigyan

Sigyan is a small utility to change levels of [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)
logger instances using SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 POSIX signals. (See `sigaction(2)` for
more information on POSIX signals).

# Usage

1. Include in your node program and indicate which loggers to modify when a
   signal is received:

        var sigyan = require('sigyan');
        sigyan.signal([LOG, backend.log]);

2. Send SIGUSR1 signal to your running node program to decrease log level:

        kill -s SIGUSR1 <PID>

3. Send SIGUSR2 signal to your running node program to increase log level:

        kill -s SIGUSR2 <PID>
